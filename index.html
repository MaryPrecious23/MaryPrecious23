		<h2>
			First topic is Mathematics
		</h2>
		<p> 
			On the 13<sup>th</sup> of October 2023, everything about subscript and superscript was taught. 
			I just want you to write it down so tnat you will not forget the day you learnt it, okay?
			so, very soon, you will learn about superscript too. But just as a reminder, 
			everything you are going to <i>learn</i> today will so simple and easy to understrand. Do not panic.
		</p> 
		<p> let's move on to superscript. 
			<b><i>Note:</i></b> 
			subscript is denoted as "sup", while superscript is denoted as "sub". let's go!
		</p>
		<p>
			In chemistry, water is denoted as H<sub>2</sub>O. 
			I hope we are following? I think we have come to the end of mathematics class. 
			we will move over to the next class. <b> I know you are following what we are doing here because we are typing 
			this as codes because we are learning html and several elements in the tags(both opening and closing tags) and 
			it is a very sweet thing to learn and understand. So, don't be confused as we deal with our digital skills prio to learning.

		<p> No matter the type of space you put in the note pad, it will not display in your browser. you need <b>LINE BREAKS AND HORIZONTAL RULES</b> This helps you to put  line breaks inside the sentence. Can someone shout <br                            /> Praise the master Jesus! Ya we just did it with for line breaks, over to horizontal rules. </P>

		<hr   />

		<p>The line breaks and the horizontal rules are called the <b>empty elements</b> because they have no word between the opening and the closing tag.  </p> 

		<p> Let's acknoledge one of our teachers <abbr title="professor">Prof</abbr> Anyanwu Precious Nkeiruka who has an acronym going in this funny way <acrony title="Anyanwu Precious Nkeiruka">PAN.</acrony> below is another examples</P>

		<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking is a theoretical Physicist and Cosmologist.</p>

		<p><acrony title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acrony> do some crazy space stuff.</p>

		<h3> <i>Citations.html</i> </H3>
		<p>I hope we are learning very fast because the energy and speed your teacher have now is wort emulating  and it's encouraging. Please my wonderfull students, try as much as possible to grasp I am teaching today as we peoceed.<hr                                                       />
		The next thing we should consider is citation in html.

		let's consider citing the picture of Aunty Precious on Facebook <cite>https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100048550845587</cite>
		<br    />
		I want us to take note of this. It is a new discouvery. some elements like citation, strong.. may not show a clear change unless bold and italics form, but they are useful during voice over for people that are disabled.

		<p>The next thing we will talk of is the author details. follow the example below   </p>

			The third chapter of my learning
		</b>
		<br   />
		<P>
			We will be looking into list today. that is the way we put items in order.They can be done in three ways namely:
	<ol>
		<li>ordered list</li>
		<li>unordered list</li>
		<li>definition list</li>
	</ol>
		For the unordered list, you do the same thing, just that you will replace ol with ul, and they will have bullets.
		The definition list is kinda different'
		It has dd and dt. dd is used to contain the deffinition whille
		 dt is used to contain the item being defined.
